COMP257/ITEC657 Data Science Portfolio 
===


Student: Diana Dalae (45612226)

In these 3 Portfolio tasks, I have managed to employ a number of data science skills, like data cleansing, data exploration, data analysis.
I modeled Linear Regression, both with one feature and multiple selected by RFE. I have successfully demonstrated a good understanding of KMeans algorithm and implemented it from scratch. 

Portfolio projects

1. Analysis of CSV data for cycling 

    * Joined two data sets from Strava and Cheetah and cleared the data. 
    * Cleared data by removing all rides not recording Power and dublicate columns 
    * Provided analysis on distribution of key variables
    * Ploted important variables against each other to look for correlations


2. Analyisis of house power consumption

    * Replicated most of the graphs in the first half of the paper
    * Interpreted the graph data and provided an analysis
    * Implemented a Linear Regression model
    * Selected 5 best features for prediction using RFE

3. KMeans Clustering

    * Successfully implemented step by step KMeans clustering algorithm
